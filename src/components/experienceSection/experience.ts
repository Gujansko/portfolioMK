    "During my time at the company, I had a great opportunity to feel what it's like to be part of a team and work under time pressure. As it was only the first time I had a chance to work on a real product I tried to make the most of it and learn as much as possible in terms of soft and software skills. My responsibilities were writing component tests and creating quiz flow. What means displaying it, answering and handling responses. I was also establishing and validating connections  regarding quizzes between frontend and backend. Our team was able to develop a web application with quizzes for internal company use. The app was also successfully used at the company's expo by hundreds of visitors.",
